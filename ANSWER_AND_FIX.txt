ANSWER TO DJANGO'S QUESTION
========================================

When Django asks:
"Was calllog.call_duration renamed to calllog.duration_minutes (a IntegerField)? [y/N]"

Answer: N (No)

Reason:
- The database already has `duration_minutes` column
- There is NO `call_duration` column to rename
- We already fixed this with fix_all_migrations.py

========================================
WHAT THE MISSING FIELDS OUTPUT SHOWS
========================================

1. CallLog Table:
   - Script checked wrong table name (leads_calllog vs call_logs)
   - The actual table `call_logs` exists and is correct
   - ✅ No action needed

2. Lead Table Issues:
   - ⚠️  Legacy columns still exist in database:
     * is_pretagged
     * assigned_by_id
     * phone_verified
     * assigned_at
     * status
     * pretag_status
     * configuration_id
     * assigned_to_id
   
   - These should have been removed by migration 0009
   - They're not in the model anymore, so Django ignores them
   - ⚠️  They're just taking up space but won't cause errors

3. Configurations (ManyToMany):
   - ✅ This is NORMAL - ManyToMany fields don't create columns
   - They create a separate join table (leads_lead_configurations)

========================================
COMMANDS TO RUN
========================================

1. Answer "N" to Django's question:
   python manage.py makemigrations leads
   # When asked: "Was calllog.call_duration renamed...?" → Answer: N

2. Apply the migration:
   python manage.py migrate leads

3. Check everything:
   python manage.py check
   python manage.py migrate

4. Start server:
   python manage.py runserver

========================================
IF YOU WANT TO CLEAN UP LEGACY COLUMNS
========================================

The legacy columns in the Lead table won't cause errors, but if you want to remove them:

1. They can be manually removed from SQLite later
2. Or we can create a data migration to rebuild the table without them
3. For now, they're safe to leave (Django ignores them)
